        <h2>Mountain</h2>
        <p>A mountain is a large natural landform that rises high above the surrounding land,
         usually with steep slopes and a peak or summit at the top. Mountains are often covered
         with rocks, soil, forests, or snow, depending on their height and climate. 
         They are formed by natural processes such as tectonic plate movements, volcanic 
         activity, or erosion over long periods of time.</p>
